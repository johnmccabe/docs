# OpenFaaS - a serverless FaaS framework {#openfaas---a-serverless-framework-for-docker--kubernetes}

### for Docker & Kubernetes

With OpenFaaS you can package anything as a serverless function - from Node.js to Golang to CSharp, even binaries like ffmpeg or ImageMagick.

You can try OpenFaaS in 60 seconds or write and deploy [your first Python function](https://blog.alexellis.io/first-faas-python-function/) in around 10-15 minutes.

So bring your laptop, your own on-prem hardware or create a cluster in the cloud. Pick Docker or Kubernetes to do the heavy lifting enabling you to build a scaleable, fault-tolerant event-driven serverless platform for your applications.
